  <h2>Examinations &amp; Tests</h2>
  <h3>Written Exams</h3>
  <p>There are NO written exams in this class.</p>
  <h3>Practical Exams</h3>

  <p>
    The practical exam is to test your personal mastery of the technical skills covered in the class. 
    You will have to complete specific tasks in a constrained time period. You will be able to use textbooks 
    and Websites, but not study guides, written notes, or files brought on disk. You will not be allowed to 
    copy source code from existing web sites. No cutting and pasting from <em>anywhere</em>, please.</p>
  <p>The practical is worth 20% of your grade and will be given the first class meeting of week 10.</p>

  <h2>Attendance &amp; Participation</h2>
  <h3>Classes</h3>
  <p>
    You are expected to attend every class. Missing just one class means you've missed a half week 
    of material, which is 5% of the material for the entire quarter. If you absolutely must miss 
    a class, it is your responsibility to find out what materials you've missed and to do the readings 
    &amp; exercises associated with that class.
  </p>

  <h3>Participation</h3>
  <p>
    Participation is more than simply showing up, however. I expect you to be an active participant in 
    the learning process. That means asking questions when you don't understand a concept, helping 
    others if you finish your work quickly, and being actively engaged in the class.
  </p>
  <h3>In-Class Exercises</h3>
  <p>
    Each class meeting will include one or more exercises and/or lab time. These may be any of a variety 
    of activities from group discussion &amp; planning to step-by-step problem solving exercises. From time to 
    time your in-class work will be checked, and this will figure into your participation grade for the quarter.
  </p>

  <h3>Study Guides/Homeworks</h3>
  <p>
    When I assign additional out-of-class materials, these materials may include study guides, tutorials, 
    and questions and answers or small tests. They will always be due at the beginning of the next class. 
    Your completion of this material will also figure into your grade for the quarter.

  <h2>Enrollment and Grading Issues</h2>
  <h3>Last day to drop</h3>
  <p>
    For this quarter, you can add/drop a class on or before <strong>&lt;&lt;must look this up&gt;&gt;</strong>. After that date, 
    you must withdraw from the course, which will show on your transcript as a "W".
  </p>

  <h3>Last day to withdraw</h3>
  <p>
    The deadline for withdrawing from a course with a "W" grade is <strong>&lt;&lt;must look this up&gt;&gt;</strong>. Forms may 
    be obtained from the IT office, and must be signed by your instructor. Completed forms should be returned 
    to the IT office no later than <strong>&lt;&lt;must look this up&gt;&gt;</strong>. After that date, a grade will be assigned based 
    on the work that you have submitted.
  </p>
  <h3>Incomplete grades</h3>
  <h4>Requesting</h4>

  <p>
    You may request an incomplete (a grade of "I") only in cases where exceptional conditions beyond your control, 
    such as accidents, severe illness, family problems, etc., have kept you from completing the course. <em>You 
    must alert us to these circumstances as soon as possible</em>. Telling your instructor in February that you 
    were sick in December is not acceptable.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Incomplete grades are not given to students who have simply fallen behind in their work</strong>.</p>
  <h4>Completing</h4>
  <p>
    If your request is granted, then you must complete the work for the course within the time limits set by the instructor. 
    <em>The maximum time to complete a grade of "I" is two (2) academic quarters. After that time, grades of "I" automatically 
    become grades of "F"</em>.

    between <em>appropriate use of sources</em> and <em>plagiarism</em>. The following sites provide excellent 
    examples of how and when to document your sources. <em>Please review these sites before turning in your first
