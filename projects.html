		<h2>Individual Midterm Web Project</h2>
		<p>
		Create an introductory UNIX tutorial website. <strong>All materials for this individual site must be 
		written by you in your own words</strong>. You may not use anything from anywhere else at all. All 
		graphics and visual images for this site must have been created by you. You may not use 
		anything from anywhere else at all. In other words, this is a website that <em>you</em> make ... all by yourself. 
		Did I remember to mention that you must make everything for this project?
		</p>

		<p>
		The website should include <em>at least 20 separate pages</em> linked (that's 20 separate .html files, or 
		the equivalent with permission of the instructor). You will be graded on your:
		</p>
		<ol>
		<li>basic design</li>
		<li>organization of information</li>
		<li>content</li>

		<li>navigation</li>
		<li>and use of XHTML &amp; CSS (both text and positioning)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		Include as a part of your project a separate linked &quot;About&quot; Web page or set of pages documenting 
		what you have done in <em>each and every</em> grading category above.
		</p>

		<p>Due not later than midnight of Wednesday of week 5 (20 percent).</p>

		<h2>Group Midterm Web Project</h2>
	  <h3>Background</h3>
	  <p>
		The design of the Web &quot;site&quot; for this class has not been reworked for several
		years, and could be better. The task for your teams is to design (and then implement for the final
		group project) a new site for this class, and one which works equally well on &quot;big screen&quot;

		and mobile devices.
	  </p>
	  <h3>Details</h3>
	  <p>
		The <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/information_architecture_tutorial/">WebMonkey Online
		Specifications</a> should be used for the design document. The design document should be completely online,
		and should not just say <em>what</em> you want to do. The design document should also clearly show <em>why</em>

		you have chosen whatever approach and content and etc which you choose to use.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		You may choose to use either XHTML (Strict) or HTML5, but you need to say why you chose one over the other.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Site Design Document</h4>
	  <p>
		Your group will create a Site Design Document with page mock-ups using the
		<a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/information_architecture_tutorial/">WebMonkey Online Specifications</a>. Note that
		there are 5 lessons on the site each one dealing with multiple sections of the document. Your group needs to
		create a document that <em>explicitly</em> deals with each and every lesson.
	  </p>

	  <p>
		Developing and presenting this sort of document is not a trivial task, and this sort of work makes a lot of consulting
		firms a lot of money. Web-aware companies know having a good design document will save them money and heartache
		in actually getting a website up and running smoothly.
	  </p>
	  <h5>The Point of the Design Document</h5>
	  <p>
		Organizing information for presentation on the Web is <em>not</em> the same as organizing information for presentation
		on paper. One of the points of giving you this material to work with is that the structure of the data is clear and already
		in place. It is pure HTML, and it has a table of contents and an organization for information chunks already in place. Your
		basic task is to communicate how this cookbook can most effectively be <em>re-organized</em> for Web navigation and presentation.
	  </p>

	  <h4>Main Tasks</h4>
	  <ul>
		<li>Goals</li>
		<li>User Experience
		  <ul>
			<li>Audience</li>
			<li>Scenarios</li>

			<li>Competative Analysis</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li>Content
		  <ul>
			<li>Content Grouping and Labeling</li>
			<li>Functional Requirements</li>
			<li>Content Inventory</li>

		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li>Site Structure
		  <ul>
			<li>Site Structure Listing (or Summary)</li>
			<li>Architectural Blueprints</li>
			<li>Global and Local Navigation Systems</li>
		  </ul>

		</li>
		<li>Visual Design
		  <ul>
			<li>Layout Grids</li>
			<li>Design Sketches</li>
			<li>Page Mock-ups</li>
			<li>Web-based Prototype</li>

		  </ul>
		</li>
	  </ul>
	  <h4>For Group Leaders</h4>
	  <p>
		I will expect group leaders to post a series of progress notes to your group project Web page, at least one per week.
		These notes should detail the progress of your group towards meeting the requirements of the project that week,
		and what each and every member of your group is going to accomplish the following week.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		In other words, <em><strong>group leaders are expected to post on the group webpage each and every week</strong>

		at least one note</em> about what concrete and measurable objectives:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		<li>your team as a whole has completed in the previous week and will complete by the time you post again the following week.</li>
		<li>
		  each and every member of your team individually has completed in the previous week and will complete by the time you post
		  again the following week.
		</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h4>Due Date &amp; Time</h4>
	  <p>
		Due Wednesday of week 6, not later than 2400 hours (20 percent).
	  </p>
	  <p>
		<strong><em>(That is 2400 hours, New York time, on the Planet Earth... the one in the Milky Way)</em></strong>
	  </p>

	 <h2>Individual Final Web Project</h2>
  <p>
    Using a few of the technologies we've covered in the second half of the course (javascript, dhtml, PHP, etc.), 
    re-create and redesign your original individual midterm Web site. Demonstrate your increased skills in more 
    than one area covered in the second half of the course (javascript, dhtml, PHP, etc.). You may need to expand 
    the content of the Web site. Include as a part of your project a separate linked page documenting what you have 
    done in each area. The idea is to demonstrate you have learned something in the second half of this term about 
    how to build Web sites and pages. The resulting project should be quite a bit different from or very much 
    refined from your individual midterm Web site.
  </p>
  <p>Due Monday of finals week at one minute before midnight (20 percent).</p>
