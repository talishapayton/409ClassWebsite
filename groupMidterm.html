		<h1>Group Midterm Web Project</h1>
		<br/>
		  <h2>Background</h2>
		  <p>
			The design of the Web &quot;site&quot; for this class has not been reworked for several
			years, and could be better. The task for your teams is to design (and then implement for the final
			group project) a new site for this class, and one which works equally well on &quot;big screen&quot;
			and mobile devices.
		  </p>
		  <h2>Details</h2>
		  <p>
			The <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/information_architecture_tutorial/">WebMonkey Online
			Specifications</a> should be used for the design document. The design document should be completely online,
			and should not just say <em>what</em> you want to do. The design document should also clearly show <em>why</em>
			you have chosen whatever approach and content and etc which you choose to use.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			You may choose to use either XHTML (Strict) or HTML5, but you need to say why you chose one over the other.
		  </p>
		  <h3>Site Design Document</h3>
		  <p>
			Your group will create a Site Design Document with page mock-ups using the
			<a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/information_architecture_tutorial/">WebMonkey Online Specifications</a>. Note that
			there are 5 lessons on the site each one dealing with multiple sections of the document. Your group needs to
			create a document that <em>explicitly</em> deals with each and every lesson.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			Developing and presenting this sort of document is not a trivial task, and this sort of work makes a lot of consulting
			firms a lot of money. Web-aware companies know having a good design document will save them money and heartache
			in actually getting a website up and running smoothly.
		  </p>
		  <h4>The Point of the Design Document</h4>
		  <p>
			Organizing information for presentation on the Web is <em>not</em> the same as organizing information for presentation
			on paper. One of the points of giving you this material to work with is that the structure of the data is clear and already
			in place. It is pure HTML, and it has a table of contents and an organization for information chunks already in place. Your
			basic task is to communicate how this cookbook can most effectively be <em>re-organized</em> for Web navigation and presentation.
		  </p>
		  <h3>Main Tasks</h3>

		  </ul>
		  <h3>For Group Leaders</h3>
		  <p>
			I will expect group leaders to post a series of progress notes to your group project Web page, at least one per week.
			These notes should detail the progress of your group towards meeting the requirements of the project that week,
			and what each and every member of your group is going to accomplish the following week.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			In other words, <em><strong>group leaders are expected to post on the group webpage each and every week</strong>
			at least one note</em> about what concrete and measurable objectives:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>your team as a whole has completed in the previous week and will complete by the time you post again the following week.</li>
			<li>
			  each and every member of your team individually has completed in the previous week and will complete by the time you post
			  again the following week.
			</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>Due Date &amp; Time</h3>
		  <p>
			Due Wednesday of week 6, not later than 2400 hours (20 percent).
		  </p>
		  <p>
			<strong><em>(That is 2400 hours, New York time, on the Planet Earth... the one in the Milky Way)</em></strong>
