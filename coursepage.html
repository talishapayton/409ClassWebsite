		  <h1>Your Course Webpage</h1>
		  
		  <h2>Location</h2>
		  <p>
			Create a <i>new</i> directory named 737 in the <strong>www</strong> 
			directory of your <strong>gibson</strong> account to hold your work, 
			and place in that directory a file called index.html. Your index.html 
			will link all subsequent assignments. That means the URI to the index.html page will be 
			<em>http://people.rit.edu/<strong>yourUserID</strong>/737/</em>
		  </p>
		  <p class="stress">YOU MUST USE THIS DIRECTORY STRUCTURE EXACTLY</p>
		  <p>Note the organization and case of the letters - yes, uppercase letters are different characters than lowercase letters...</p>
		  <h2>Description</h2>
		  <p>
			This is the page from which all other work you do for this course will be linked. 
			This is a "one stop center" for me to use to find everything you do for this course.
		  </p>
		  <h3>Your Info</h3>
		  <p>The page must include a picture of yourself, your name, and your <i>RIT</i> e-mail address (make it hard for machines to &quot;scrape&quot; the address).</p>
		  <h3>Projects Links</h3>
		  <p>
			Make placeholders for links to your 2 individual projects (midterm and final) and your 
			2 group projects (midterm and final). The URIs pointing to your midterm and final projects 
			should end up looking like this:
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li>http://people.rit.edu/<strong>yourUserID</strong>/737/midterm/</li>
			<li>http://people.rit.edu/<strong>yourUserID</strong>/737/final/</li>
		  </ul>
		  <h3>Exercises Links</h3>
		  <p>You must also include a list, to which you will gradually add list items containing links to each of the exercises you will complete for this class.</p>
		  <h3>Simplicity</h3>
		  <p>
			Do your best to use the principles of design you learned in 741. I want to see the best you can do, 
			but that does not mean putting in every type of bell and whistle you can imagine. Keep it as simple
			and clean as you can. Remember what Einstein said:
		  </p>
		  <p class="indented">
			<em>The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few 
			as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience.</em> 
			[<a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Einstein" title="visit wikiquote article on Einstein">from wikiquote</a>]
		  </p>
		  <p>To paraphrase:</p>
		  <p class="indented">"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler."</p>
		  <h2>Due Date</h2>
		  <p>Monday night of week two, by one minute before midnight.</p>
		  <hr />
